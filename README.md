## Mini-Guide: Installation and Makefile


The easiest way to test and install all required software, test everything 
and compile the documentation is to run

``bash$ make all``

``make all`` installs all required software, unittests all tested software
in ``tests/`` and compiles the html documentation located in ``docs/`` 
(it does not compile the latexpdf automatically, our Jenkins CI server does not
provide a function that ``Sphinx`` needs, which is called ``latexmk``; hence, 
the automatic building of the documentation would fail).

There are a couple of other options using the ``Makefile``. 

- ``make init`` will install the required software using ``pip install``

- ``make docs`` will generate the automatic documentation of all modules 
  in the packages ``input``, ``src`` and ``tests`` using apidoc. The
  autogenerated ``.rst`` files are then used to compile ``html`` documentation.
  The ``html`` file is then located in the directory ``docs/build/html``.

- ``make latexpdf`` will generate a latex pdf containing the documentation.
  The document will then be located in the directory ``docs/build/latex``.

- ``make cleandocs`` cleans out both the auto-generated files as well as the
  compiled documents.

- ``make cleanresults`` cleans the results folder

- ``make clean`` cleans both results and documents.
